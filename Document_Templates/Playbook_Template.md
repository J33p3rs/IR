# [Threat Scenario] - Playbook

# 1.Purpose
The Purpose of this document is to describe the steps used to respond to a [Threat Scenario] event.
# 2. Preparation
To prepare for a [Threat Scenario] the organisation will need:
* Detections / logs
* Process
* Policies


# 3. Detection and Analysis 
## 3.1 Determine if an incident has occured
|Action | Responsible |
|---|---|
| <b>Begin documenting the evidence</b> <br> Once an analyst believes an incident has or likely has occured they should start documenting the investigation into the incident: <br> <ul><li>Overview of the incident, how it was detected <li>Indicators and precursors relating to the incident  <li>Evidence relating to the incident such as email sent and received <li>Communications relating to the incident <li>Decisions made during the incident <li>Escalation to Incident Response Lead, SIRT or other stakeholders <li>Other relevant dot points </ul> | Incident Response Analyst <br> Other stakeholders once notified |
|<b>Analyse precursors and indicators</b><br> A [Threat Scenario] event will normally be reported by [staff / security tools / customers]. <br> Determining the basics of the event:<br><ul><li>Relevant dot points </ul><br> Reviewing Logs:<br><ul><li>Relevant dot points</ul>  | [Role] |
| <b> Look for correlating evidence</b><br> Correlating information will help determine the scope of the incident. The following can be checked in the logs: <ul><li>Relevant dot points</ul> | [Role] |
| <b>Perform research</b><br>Further research can help understand and identify the scope of an incident. Record any additional indicators found. <br><ul><li>Relevant dot points</ul> | [Role] | 
| <b>Prioritise the incident</b><br> Prioritise the incident based on [Guidelines / Policy Name] | [Role] |
| <b>Report the incident</b><br>Report the incident following the guidleines in the Incident Management Policy.<br><ul><li>relevant dot points</ul> | [Role] |

# 4. Conatinment, Eradication and Recovery
## 4.1 Aquire, preserve, secure and document evidence
All evidence should be aquired and securely stored.
## 4.2 Contain the incident
|Action | Responsible |
|---|---|
|The following can help contain a [Threat Scenario] incident <br><ul><li>Relevant dot points</ul> | [Role] |

## 4.3 Eradicate the Incident
* Identify and mitigate all vulnerabilities that were exploited
  * Relevant dot points
* Remove malware, inappropriate materials, and other components
  * Relevant dot points
* If more affected hosts are discovered
  * Repeat the Detection and Analysis steps to identify all other affected hosts, then contain and eradicate the incident for them.

## Recover from the Incident
* Return affected systems to an operationally ready state
 * Dot points specific to the scenario
* Confirm that the affected systems are functioning normally
  * Dot points specific to the scenario
* If necessary, implement additional monitoring to look for future related activity
  * Dots points specific to the scenario


# 5. Post-Incident Activity
## Hold a lessons leared meeting

## Create a follow-up Report
