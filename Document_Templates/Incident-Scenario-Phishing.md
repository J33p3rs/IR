# Phishing Incident Response Scenario with 3 Escalations

## Initial Incident Response

An employee reports that they have received a suspicious email that appears to be a phishing attempt. The email claims to be from a reputable company, but the employee noticed some red flags, such as incorrect grammar and a suspicious link. The employee did not click on the link and reported the incident to the IT department.

## First Escalation

Upon investigation, the IT department determines that the phishing email was sent to a large number of employees, and some may have already clicked on the link. The IT department immediately sends out a company-wide warning email advising all employees not to click on any suspicious links or provide any sensitive information in response to emails.

The IT department also checks the company's email security system to identify any other suspicious emails that may have been missed, and they update the system's rules to block any future attempts from similar sources.

## Second Escalation

A few hours later, the IT department receives reports of several employees who have clicked on the phishing link and have entered their login credentials on a fake website. The IT department immediately disables those employees' accounts and resets their passwords.

The IT department also begins to monitor the affected accounts for any suspicious activity, such as logins from unfamiliar locations or changes to account settings. They also reach out to the affected employees to provide them with guidance on how to protect their personal information and report any suspicious activity.

## Third Escalation

The IT department notices that the phishing attack was more widespread than initially thought, and a significant number of employees have clicked on the link and entered their login credentials. The IT department determines that the attackers may have gained access to some sensitive data and alerts the company's senior management.

The company's senior management immediately engages the company's incident response team to investigate the incident further. The incident response team works to determine the extent of the damage and develops a plan to contain the incident and prevent any further damage.

The incident response team also works with the IT department to identify the source of the attack and gather any evidence that could be used to pursue legal action against the attackers. The incident response team communicates regularly with senior management to provide updates on the incident and to ensure that the company's response is aligned with its overall business objectives.
