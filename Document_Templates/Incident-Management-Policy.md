# Incident Management Policy

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for handling security incidents that affect the organisation's information systems and data. The policy defines the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team and establishes procedures for reporting, detecting, analysing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the organisation's information systems and data.

## Definitions
- **Security Incident**: An event that violates the organisation's security policies or procedures and threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information systems and data.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: A group of individuals who are responsible for managing security incidents and ensuring that they are resolved in a timely and effective manner.
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**: A documented plan that outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- The Incident Response Team (IRT) is responsible for managing security incidents and ensuring that they are resolved in a timely and effective manner.
- The Information Security Officer (ISO) is responsible for overseeing the IRT and ensuring that the organisation's security policies and procedures are followed.
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors are responsible for reporting security incidents to the IRT as soon as they are detected.

## Incident Response Procedures
### 1. Preparation
- Develop and maintain an Incident Response Plan (IRP) that outlines the procedures for detecting, reporting, analysing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.
- Identify and train members of the Incident Response Team (IRT) who are responsible for managing security incidents.
- Establish procedures for notifying the IRT, senior management, and other stakeholders in the event of a security incident.

### 2. Detection and Analysis
- Establish procedures for detecting security incidents, including the use of intrusion detection systems, log monitoring, and other security technologies.
- Notify the IRT immediately upon detection of a security incident.
- Analyse the security incident to determine the scope and severity of the incident, including:
  - Identifying the source of the incident, if possible.
  - Gathering evidence and preserving it for analysis.
  - Classifying the incident according to its severity level.
  - Assessing the impact of the incident on the organisation's information systems and data.

### 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- Contain the security incident to prevent further damage to the organisation's information systems and data, including:
  - Isolating affected systems from the network.
  - Shutting down affected systems, if necessary.
  - Blocking network traffic associated with the incident.
- Eradicate the security incident by removing the threat from the organisation's information systems and data, including:
  - Removing malware or other malicious software.
  - Patching vulnerabilities that were exploited.
  - Restoring affected systems to their pre-incident state.
- Recover from the security incident by restoring the affected information systems and data to their normal operational state, including:
  - Verifying the integrity of the recovered systems and data.
  - Conducting tests to ensure that the systems and data are functioning properly.
  - Monitoring the systems and data to ensure that there are no residual effects of the incident.

### 4. Post-Incident Activity
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and make recommendations for improving the Incident Response Plan (IRP).
- Document the security incident and the steps taken to contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident.
- Notify senior management and other stakeholders of the security incident and the steps taken to contain, eradicate, and recover
