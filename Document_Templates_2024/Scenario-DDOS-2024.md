# Scenario: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack Incident Response Test

## Background
[Your Organisation] relies heavily on its online presence to conduct business operations, including e-commerce transactions and customer support. Recently, there have been industry-wide reports of increased DDoS attacks targeting companies in your sector. To ensure preparedness, the Incident Response Team (IRT) will conduct a simulated DDoS attack scenario to test the Incident Response Plan (IRP).

## Incident Timeline and Escalations

### Initial Detection and Analysis (Escalation 1)
**Time: 09:00 AM**

- **Event:** The network operations centre (NOC) detects unusually high traffic volumes targeting the organisationâ€™s web servers. The traffic appears to be coming from multiple IP addresses, indicating a potential DDoS attack.
- **Action:**
  - The NOC alerts the Incident Response Team (IRT).
  - The IT Security Manager begins initial analysis using network monitoring tools to confirm the nature and scope of the attack.
  - The IRT classifies the incident as a potential DDoS attack and initiates the Incident Response Plan.

### Containment (Escalation 2)
**Time: 09:30 AM**

- **Event:** The attack intensity increases, causing significant degradation in the performance of the organisation's primary website. Customers begin reporting issues accessing the site.
- **Action:**
  - The Incident Response Coordinator escalates the incident to the Incident Response Team, invoking the containment phase of the IRP.
  - Short-term containment measures are implemented:
    - Redirect traffic to a secondary data centre.
    - Deploy rate-limiting rules on the firewall to mitigate incoming traffic.
    - Engage the DDoS protection service provider to help absorb and filter the malicious traffic.
  - The Communications Officer prepares a preliminary status update for internal stakeholders, including the executive team and customer support, to ensure consistent messaging.

### Eradication and Recovery (Escalation 3)
**Time: 10:30 AM**

- **Event:** Despite initial containment efforts, the attack persists and evolves. The attackers change tactics, shifting the traffic patterns to bypass some of the implemented filters. This results in intermittent outages affecting critical business applications.
- **Action:**
  - The Incident Response Coordinator escalates the incident to the highest level, convening a crisis management team including representatives from IT, Legal, Communications, and Business Continuity.
  - Long-term containment and eradication measures are put in place:
    - Collaborate with the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to block traffic at the network edge.
    - Update and refine firewall and IDS/IPS rules based on new attack patterns.
    - Identify and isolate compromised systems or components that may be amplifying the attack.
  - The Business Continuity Manager coordinates efforts to activate alternative communication channels and backup systems to maintain critical operations.
  - The Communications Officer issues a public statement acknowledging the attack and providing guidance to customers, ensuring transparency and trust.

### Post-Incident Activities
**Time: 01:00 PM**

- **Event:** The DDoS attack subsides, and normal traffic levels resume. The IRT confirms that all malicious traffic has been mitigated, and systems are stable.
- **Action:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive post-incident review to analyse the response, identify strengths and weaknesses, and document lessons learned.
  - Update the Incident Response Plan and associated procedures based on the findings from the review.
  - Prepare a detailed incident report for internal stakeholders and regulatory bodies, if applicable.
  - Plan a debrief meeting with all involved teams to communicate the outcomes and reinforce training and preparedness.

## Objectives of the Test
- **Evaluate the effectiveness of the Incident Response Plan (IRP):** Ensure that all phases of the IRP (Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Post-Incident Activities) are executed efficiently.
- **Assess communication protocols:** Verify that internal and external communications are handled promptly and accurately.
- **Test coordination and collaboration:** Ensure that all relevant teams (IRT, IT, Legal, Communications, Business Continuity) work together seamlessly during an incident.
- **Identify gaps and areas for improvement:** Use the scenario to uncover any weaknesses in the current incident response processes and make necessary improvements.

This scenario provides a structured approach to testing your incident response plan against a DDoS attack, involving multiple escalations to evaluate the team's preparedness and the effectiveness of the response strategies.
