# Incident Management Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the incident management framework for [Your Organisation]. It outlines the procedures for identifying, managing, and responding to information security incidents to minimise impact, ensure swift recovery, and enhance overall security posture.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and agents with access to [Your Organisation]'s information systems and data.

## Definitions
- **Incident:** An occurrence that jeopardises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT):** A group of individuals responsible for preparing for and responding to incidents.
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP):** A documented strategy for responding to incidents, detailing the roles, responsibilities, procedures, and resources required.

## Policy Statements

### 1. Preparation
- **Establishing the IRT:**
  - Define and document the roles and responsibilities of the Incident Response Team (IRT).
  - Appoint a designated Incident Response Coordinator to lead the IRT.
  - Ensure the IRT is composed of representatives from key departments, including IT, Legal, HR, and Communications.

- **Developing the IRP:**
  - Create and maintain an Incident Response Plan (IRP) that includes detailed procedures for incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities.
  - Review and update the IRP at least annually or after significant changes to the organisation's environment or threat landscape.

- **Training and Awareness:**
  - Conduct regular training sessions for all employees on recognising and reporting security incidents.
  - Provide specialised training for IRT members to ensure they are proficient in their roles.

- **Asset Management:**
  - Maintain an up-to-date inventory of critical assets and prioritise them in the incident response plan.
  - Classify assets based on their criticality to the organisation's operations.

### 2. Detection and Analysis
- **Monitoring:**
  - Implement continuous monitoring tools and techniques to detect potential incidents.
  - Use intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and other automated tools for real-time monitoring.

- **Incident Reporting:**
  - Establish a clear and easy-to-follow process for reporting suspected incidents.
  - Ensure all employees are aware of the reporting process and their responsibility to report incidents immediately.

- **Incident Analysis:**
  - Collect and analyse data from affected systems to determine the nature, scope, and impact of the incident.
  - Classify incidents based on predefined severity levels and prioritise response actions accordingly.
  - Document all findings in an incident tracking system for future reference and analysis.

### 3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- **Containment:**
  - Develop and implement containment strategies to prevent the spread of the incident and minimise its impact.
  - Use both short-term containment measures (e.g., isolating affected systems) and long-term containment strategies (e.g., applying patches or reconfiguring firewalls).

- **Eradication:**
  - Identify and eliminate the root cause of the incident, such as removing malware or closing vulnerabilities.
  - Verify that all malicious artefacts have been removed from the affected systems.

- **Recovery:**
  - Restore affected systems and data to normal operations as quickly as possible.
  - Verify the integrity and security of restored systems before bringing them back online.
  - Monitor systems closely for any signs of recurrence or additional issues.

### 4. Post-Incident Activities
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Conduct a thorough post-incident review to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement.
  - Document findings and update the IRP and related procedures based on the review.

- **Reporting:**
  - Prepare detailed incident reports for internal stakeholders and, if necessary, external parties such as regulatory bodies.
  - Ensure reports include a summary of the incident, actions taken, and recommendations for preventing future incidents.

- **Communication:**
  - Establish clear guidelines for communicating with internal and external stakeholders during and after an incident.
  - Ensure timely, accurate, and consistent communication to maintain trust and transparency.

### 5. Metrics and Continuous Improvement
- **Incident Metrics:**
  - Track key metrics such as incident detection time, response time, and recovery time.
  - Analyse metrics to assess the effectiveness of the incident response program and identify trends.

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Regularly review and update the incident response policy and procedures to reflect changes in the threat landscape and organisational environment.
  - Conduct periodic incident response drills and exercises to validate the effectiveness of the IRP and team readiness.
  - Incorporate feedback from drills, exercises, and post-incident reviews to continually improve the incident response process.

### 6. Compliance and Enforcement
- **Compliance:**
  - Ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards related to incident management.
  - Conduct regular audits to verify adherence to this policy and identify areas for improvement.

- **Enforcement:**
  - Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
  - Contractors, vendors, and agents who violate this policy may face penalties as per their contract terms.

## Approval
This policy is approved by the [Executive Leadership/Board of Directors] and is effective as of [Date].
